						<p class="italic bold">
							During my bachelor's, I was involved with 2 committees that carried out <span class="text-orange-900">entrepreneural projects in tourism</span>, taking care of the graphics production, marketing as well as acquiring and handling some customers. It was very hands on with no assisstance from the university. Both trips were successful and taught us quite a bit.
						</p>
						...
						<p class="italic bold mb-1">
							I was a <span class="text-orange-900">research assisstant in my department</span> for a period of 3 months under a distinguished professor, doing research as well as coding and running small programs under the study of quantum optics in which I did my final year project.
						</p>
						...
						<p class="italic bold mb-1">
							Towards the end of my bachelor's, I did an <span class="text-orange-900">internship for a period of 6 months in a software startup</span> called IIUM Advanced Technologies (IAT). There, I was exposed to an industry development environment, gained valuable experience in full stack development and helped deploy some deliverables on-site overseas. During the time working with them on the MES & Enterprise system I learned a lot including the use of bitbucket and online repositories with a team and development with the Laravel PHP framework, and was exposed to deployment at the local server of the client.

						<h1 class="font-black font-display text-gray-900 text-3xl my-3">Education</h1>
						<p class="italic bold">
							I studied in <span class="text-orange-900">international institutes</span> since childhood & built up my written and verbal communication skills, along with lots of presentations and reports during higher education. The diversity helped develop an open mind and global as well as local (Malaysian) thinking. I was usually comfortable with project and team leadership.
						</p>
						...
						<p class="italic bold mb-1">
							Having done foundation studies in Engineering and a Bachelor's degree in computer science, I was exposed to various emerging fields such as blockchain, cybersecurity, quantum optics and wireless sensor networks, and built solid fundamentals in economics, entrepreneurship and business design. We also covered much of the Cisco CCNA networking and enterprise networking modules.

						<p class="italic bold mb-1">
							I always had a passion for art which gravitated towards digital art and the environment in which it thrives. From there, <span class="text-orange-grad">many software skills were self-taught</span> including various graphic design and productivity software. Projects got me further exposed to software like Solidworks for CAD and Wolfram Mathematica for mathematical programs.

							Entering the world of highly interactive software grew my <span class="text-orange-grad">interest in software development and UI/UX design</span> and their impact.

							Outside of professional work & practice, I'm currently trying to make <span class="text-orange-grad">educational and expressive social media content</span> when and however I can.
